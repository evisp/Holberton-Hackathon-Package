# Submission Guidelines 

## What to submit
- A single GitHub repository link (one repo per team). 
- Your team name + team members (names + roles if you want). 

## Required for a valid submission
1) Working demo flow (must be possible to show live)
- Browse listings → open details → show ML estimate + fair range → show comparable properties (comps).

2) README.md (must be clear)
Include:
- Project name + 1–2 sentences describing what you built. 
- How to run the backend (exact commands). 
- How to run the frontend / UI (exact commands). 
- Any environment variables (if any) and example values. 
- If you trained a model: how to train + where the saved model file is used. 

3) Code
- Backend code (API) and frontend/UI code must be included in the repo. 
- Your ML training code must be included (notebook or script). 

## API expectations (recommended)
Provide at least these endpoints (names can differ):
- List / search listings
- Predict price (returns estimate + range)
- Get comps for a listing

## Demo (during presentations)
- 7–10 minutes max
- Show:
  1) Filters on the listings page
  2) Details page
  3) Estimate + range
  4) Comps list and why they are similar

## Bonus (optional to include)
- A short screen recording (link) in the README. 
- Screenshots in the README. 
- A short note: “What we would do next with more time.”

## Rules
- App must run locally for judging.
- Use only the provided dataset (no external paid data/APIs).
